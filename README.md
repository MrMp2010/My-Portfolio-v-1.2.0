## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation and Setup

To get this project up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/mrmp2010/React-E-commerce-Portfolio.git](https://github.com/mrmp2010/React-E-commerce-Portfolio.git)
    cd React-E-commerce-Portfolio
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    This project uses `npm`. Navigate to the project root and install all necessary packages:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Start the mock backend server:**
    The project relies on `json-server` for a local API. Run the following command in a **separate terminal** to start the mock server:

    ```bash
    npm run server
    ```
    This will typically run on `http://localhost:8000`. The `db.json` file contains initial user data and login tokens.

4.  **Start the React development server:**
    In your main terminal, start the React application:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    The application should open in your browser, usually at `http://localhost:3000`.

## üöÄ How to Use

Once the application is running:

* **Navigate:** Use the circular links on the initial home page to go to different sections (Page 1 for e-commerce, Page 2 for a product counter demo, Page 3 for user/product management).
* **Browse Products (Page 1):** Explore products on the `Products` page. You can filter by category or use the search bar.
* **Product Details (Page 1):** Click on any product to view its detailed information.
* **Add to Cart (Page 1):** Add products to your shopping cart from product listings or detail pages.
* **Shopping Cart (Page 1):** Access your cart via the cart icon in the navigation bar to review items, adjust quantities, or remove items.
* **User Authentication (Page 3):**
    * **Login:** Access the login page (`/page3/login`). You can use existing mock user credentials (e.g., from `db.json`) or register a new account.
    * **Register:** Create a new user account (`/page3/register`).
    * **Protected Routes:** Features like the `Dashboard`, `Users` list, and `Cart` within Page 3 are protected and require a logged-in user.
* **Dark Mode (Page 1):** Toggle the theme between light and dark mode using the sun/moon icon in the navigation bar.
* **Homepage:** A visual of the main landing page.
* **Product List:** An image showing products with filtering and search.
* **Shopping Cart:** A screenshot of the cart with items added.
* **Login/Register Forms:** A visual of the user authentication forms.
* **Dark Mode:** A side-by-side comparison or a single image demonstrating dark mode.
* **Admin Panel (Page 3):** Screenshot of the dashboard or user list.

## üí° Future Development

Here are some ideas for future enhancements and improvements to the project:

* **API Integration:** Replace the mock `json-server` backend with a real RESTful API (e.g., Node.js with Express, Python with Django/Flask) for persistent data storage.
* **Payment Gateway Integration:** Implement a secure payment gateway (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) for actual transactions.
* **State Management:** Introduce a more robust state management library like Redux Toolkit or Zustand for complex global state.
* **Advanced Search & Filtering:** Implement more sophisticated search capabilities, including sorting options and advanced filters.
* **User Profiles:** Allow users to manage their profiles, view order history, and save preferences.
* **Admin Panel:** Develop a more comprehensive admin dashboard for managing products, orders, and users.
* **Image Optimization:** Implement image optimization techniques for faster loading times (e.g., lazy loading, responsive images).
* **Accessibility (a11y):** Further enhance accessibility features to ensure the application is usable by everyone.
* **Testing:** Expand unit and integration tests to cover more components and functionalities.
